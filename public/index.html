  Hello World.....<br/>
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br/>Lorem Ipsum has been 
  the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br/>
  of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <br/>
  but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised <br/>
  in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
  <br/>with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  <br/>
Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page<br/>
 when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal <br/>
 distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
 <br/>readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum <br/>
 as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
 <br/>their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes<br/>
  on purpose (injected humour and the like).

<br/>
Where does it come from?<br/>
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,<br/> a Latin 
professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, <br/>
consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
<br/>discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
<br/>onorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a 
<br/>treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem 
Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br/>
<br/>
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. <br/>
Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in <br/>
their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
